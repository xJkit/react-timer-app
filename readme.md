## A Timer App with Countdown functionality.
#### This is a Single Page Application implemented by React.


To kick off, You need to start with __webpack__:
```
> webpack -w -d
```
If you don't have __webpack__ globally installed, just run npm script instead:
```
> npm run watch
```
You can run unit testing here, with __Karma__ installed:
```
> npm test
```

then start a node server:
```
> npm run start
```
It will start a node server. Have fun!
